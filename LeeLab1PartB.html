	<dt>What is DOCTYPE statement?</dt>
    <dd>DOCTYPE notifies the browser about which version of the markup language the page is written in.</dd>
  <dt>How to use ordered, unordered, and definition list tags:</dt>
    <dd>Each of these lists start with angled brackets and end with the angled brackets but with a forward slash. They all have defined items within the list.
      <ul>
        <li>&lt;ol&gt; can be used when you are listing items.</li>
        <li>&lt;ul&gt; can be used when you are listing items but the order does not matter.</li>
        <li>&lt;dl&gt; can be used when you are defining terms.</li>
      </ul>
   </dd>
  <dt>Text Editor VS Word Processor</dt>
    <dd>A text editor is a program that allows you to create and edit plain text files. It is designed for writing and editing code, scripts, and other types of text-based documents. Text editor only works with text, it doesn't use any other type of characters. Word processor is a more advanced program that produces error-free documents, while working with complex programming such as fonts, formatting, automatic grammar and spelling checks, predefined themes/templates, and many more features!</dd>
  <dt>What is the client-server model?</dt>
   <dd>The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Clients and servers communicate over a computer network or on the same machine.</dd>
  <dt>What are the following network protocols?:</dt>
   <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>FTP provides client access to file servers. It's defined as the file transfer protocol. IT allows the user to open, login, and close connections in addition to upload, download, rename, delete, and collect information on files. FTP works hand in hand with PHP 3</li>
      <li>HTTP is defined as hyper text transfer protocol and works with the world wide web (www) by sending http requests and receiving http responses. It works when a browser sends an http request to the web, the web receives the request and outputs an http response, where the browser receives the response. </li>
      <li>TCP/IP is defined as transmission control protocol/internet protocol and is responsible for communication protocols that establish the rules for how servers exchange data across networks. Both TCP and IP work together to handle logical addressing and routing of data while TCP handles error-free delivery of data across devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>In one pot, take your 150g of mango, 35g sugar, and 5g of lemon juice, and stir on medium heat until you have a smooth mango puree!</li>
    <li>Save 30g of your mango puree, this will be used later on!</li>

  <h3>Next, we're going to make our cake layer!</h3>
  <ol>
    <img src="/Users/heather/Desktop/egg mixture.png" style="width:300px">

    <li>In a bowl, mix 2 eggs, 60g sugar, and 2g vanilla extract together on low heat, until eggs become slightly translucent. Using a thermometer, this mixture should be around 40 degrees C.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, put 20g unsalted btter and 25g of milk together on low heat, but do not mix.</li>
    <li>With your egg mixture, mix until light and fluffly!</li>
    <li>In the same bowl that you just mixed, use a sifter to sift 65g of cake flour and mix with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Next, grab the bowl that had unsalted butter and milk---it should be melted now. And take one spoonful with the spatula in the butter and milk mixture, and mix together.</li>
    <li>Once mixed together, grab that mixture and pour it into your batter and mix with spatula. You should get a smooth batter!</li>
    <li>Pour into square cake tray of 21cm.</li>
    <img src="/Users/heather/Desktop/cake batter.png" style="width:300px;">
    <li>Preheat your oven to 185 degrees.</li>
    <li>Bake in oven for about 22 minutes at 165 degrees C.</li>
    <li>Once baked, allow your cake to cool, then slice into 1.5m thick slices and cut into 5cm squares.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Now, let's make our cheesecake layer!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix together 20g water and 4g of powdered gelatin for 10 minutes or more. Mix by shaking the bowl.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, take your 200g of cream cheese, mix until soft.</li>
    <li>In the same bowl, add 45g sugar, 3g vanilla extract, and 5g of lemon juice. Whisk until smooth.</li>
    <li>From the mango puree you made earlier, add 30g to your bowl and continue whisking.</li>
    <li>Microwave your gelatin mixture for about 20 seconds, then add to your cheesecake mixture. Whisk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Grab 130g of heavy whipping cream and blend until it appears thick.</li>
    <li>Add your whipping cream in your cheesecake bowl and whisk until light.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Finally, let's assemble our cheesecake!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Grab your mango puree from the silicone mold and attach it together to form a full circle.</li>

    <li>Then, grab your cake mold of 5cm, and with a piping bag, pour your cheesecake mixture a little above the halfway mark.</li>
    <li>Take your ball of mango puree and place it in the middle of the mold.</li>
    <li>Using a long tool like a chopstick or toothpick, slightly push the mango puree into the mixture until majority of the ball is submerged into the cheesecake.</li>
    <li>Grab your piping bag with cheesecake and cover the top of the mango puree.</li>
    <li>With your 5cm cut cake slices, place it at the top of the mold.</li>
    <li>Freeze your cake overnight.</li>
    <li>Once frozen, take out of mold and decorate with fresh mango pieces or anything of your choosing!</li>
    <li>Enjoy your delicious mini mango cheesecake!</li>
